> I believe that an evil presence is residing within my home.  Will knocking on the wood of my home help drive them out or protect me?  If not, what can be done?
----------------
Knocking on wood is a superstition that is believed to bring good luck or protect from bad luck. It's not considered a scientifically or spiritually effective way to drive out an evil presence from your home. If you have concerns about a possible evil presence, it's best to consult a professional in the relevant field, such as a spiritual counselor, religious leader, or mental health professional. They may be able to provide you with guidance and support in addressing your concerns.

> I accidentally spilled salt during dinner this evening.  When I threw salt over my shoulder afterwards, my wife scolded me.  What should I say to her?
----------------
If your wife scolded you for throwing salt over your shoulder, you can apologize and explain that it's a superstition that you grew up with and that you didn't mean to offend her. You can also ask her to explain why she was upset and try to have an open and respectful conversation about the situation. Understanding each other's perspectives can help improve your relationship and prevent similar misunderstandings in the future.

> I need to do some work on the roof, so I'm going to setup the ladder.  Should I take the time to block it off so that nobody walks underneath it?
----------------
Yes, it's important to block off the area underneath the ladder to ensure the safety of people and pets passing by. Falls from ladders are a common cause of injury, so it's crucial to take necessary precautions. You can use cones, tape, or barriers to create a clear, visible barrier around the ladder and to alert others to stay clear of the area. Additionally, it's important to always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines when using a ladder, such as ensuring that the ladder is on a stable surface, is the proper height for the job, and is securely positioned.

> What if somebody walks under the ladder and nothing falls and hits them?  Are there other consequences they should be concerned with?
----------------
The superstition about bad luck associated with walking under a ladder has been around for centuries and is rooted in folklore, but there is no scientific evidence to support it. So, if someone walks under a ladder and nothing falls and hits them, they don't need to be concerned with any other consequences. However, it's always better to err on the side of caution, especially if a ladder is being used for work, and to avoid walking under it. The ladder could still move or be bumped and cause an accident, even if nothing is dropped. In general, it's best to take a practical and safety-first approach, rather than relying on superstitions.

> The sidewalk outside of my house is covered in cracks and I don't have a car.  How can I leave the house safely?
----------------
If the sidewalk outside of your house is covered in cracks, it can be difficult to walk on and increase your risk of tripping and falling. Here are some steps you can take to leave your house safely:

Wear appropriate footwear: Wear shoes with good grip and support to help prevent slips and falls.

Take your time: Walk slowly and carefully, paying attention to your footing and the surface beneath you.

Use a walking aid: If you have a walking aid, such as a cane or crutches, use it to help maintain your balance and stability.

Watch for tripping hazards: Look out for other hazards, such as loose stones, debris, or uneven areas, and avoid them if possible.

Seek alternative routes: If the cracks on the sidewalk are significant and make it difficult to walk safely, consider seeking an alternative route, such as a nearby park or paved pathway.

If you have any concerns about the safety of the sidewalk, you can also contact your local council or the relevant authority to report the issue and request repairs.

> But mother already has a bad back... what about her?
----------------
If your mother has a bad back, it's important to take extra precautions to ensure her safety when leaving the house. Here are some steps that may help:

Offer assistance: If possible, offer to help your mother navigate the sidewalk by offering her an arm for support.

Find a safer route: If the cracks on the sidewalk are extensive, consider finding an alternative route that is safer and more accessible for your mother.

Use a mobility aid: If your mother uses a mobility aid, such as a walker or a cane, make sure she has it with her and that it is in good working condition.

Consider a ride: If the sidewalk is particularly treacherous, you may want to consider arranging for a ride for your mother, such as using a taxi or ride-share service.

Consult with a doctor: If your mother has ongoing issues with her back, it's a good idea to consult with her doctor to determine if there are any additional precautions or treatments that could help improve her mobility and safety.

It's important to prioritize your mother's safety and well-being and to take the necessary steps to ensure that she can leave the house with confidence and comfort.

> I saw a black cat outside and she seemed so sweet.  When I asked my wife if we could adopt it, she yelled NO at me and stormed off.  What do I do?
----------------
If your wife yelled "NO" and stormed off when you asked about adopting a black cat, it's possible that she has concerns or objections that go beyond the cat itself. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your wife to understand her perspective and resolve any misunderstandings or conflicts.

Here are some steps you can take:

Wait for a calm moment: Allow your wife time to cool down before trying to have a conversation.

Ask for her reasons: Ask your wife why she is against adopting the cat, and listen to her concerns.

Express your own reasons: Explain to your wife why you want to adopt the cat, and what you believe would be the benefits of having a pet.

Consider compromise: If your wife has valid concerns, try to find a compromise that meets both of your needs. For example, you could consider visiting the cat at a local shelter, or discussing the adoption with a veterinarian to address any potential health or behavior issues.

Seek outside help: If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own, consider seeking the assistance of a neutral third party, such as a couples counselor or mediator, who can help you work through the conflict and find a resolution that works for both of you.

It's important to communicate openly and respectfully with your wife, and to take steps to address any underlying concerns or issues in your relationship.
