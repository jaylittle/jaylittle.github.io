      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to settle down a bit and as a result I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten married. Who was the lucky (unlucky?) girl you ask?

      <description>Why? The purpose of this article is to document various recipes that have been floating around in my family and Annette&amp;rsquo;s family for years now. Some of these were handwritten, some of them were typed up in a more formal fashion, but all of them were essentially kept within the family. Until now.
Annette and I have seen a lot of family members pass over the last few years and making some of their recipes has helped to keep the memory of these departed family members alive so to speak.</description>
