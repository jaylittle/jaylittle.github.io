I call up TiVo today looking to cancel and they begin threatening a huge cancellation fee. I tell them that I’ve not under contract at which point they insist that I am. Then they tell me that it’ll cost $150 for me to break that contract. I am then put on hold and left to stew for a few minutes.

So for now I’ve opted to take this approach. That way when I call back up next month to cancel, it’ll cost me less of my precious credit score to turn around and frak them up their asses. Of course they may just lower the rate again, which only means I’ll wait until the following month for another bout.\nScrew TiVo. Screw the Cable Company for their shitty DVR service too. At this rate, I really hope DirecTV’s service is that damn good, because otherwise I’m going to be up the creek without a paddle when it comes to DVR service. I may just end up building my own Media Center or MythTV box.\nWhat a bunch of drama. TV really shouldn’t be this hard people.\n",
